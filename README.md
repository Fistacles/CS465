# Architecture
# Compare and contrast the types of frontend development you used in your full stack project, including Express, HTML, JavaScript, and the single-page application (SPA)

In the project we used Express, HTML, JavaScript, and SPA. Express was used when using handlebars with database info or to retrive the static HTML page. Express was used to
communicate with the frontend and with servers. JavaScript was used to create routes and controllers, and allowed the website to be interactable for the customer, letting
the user click on links or buttons and having them do something instead of just being a static, clickable image. When using Angluar to load up the entire SPA meant that all loading was done client-side. The only calls needed to backend are done for databases, meaning that communication needed was minimal, while Express calls back to the server multiple times.

 # Why did the backend use a NoSQL MongoDB database?

 MongoDB has excellent scalability and works well with the formats we were using. It's a commonly used tool for web develepers as it is quick and easy to use and works well with many front end formats.

 # Functionality
# How is JSON different from JavaScript and how does JSON tie together the frontend and backend development pieces?

Javascrip and JSON are not directly related. Javascript is a programming language that uses JSON but JSON itself is a way of formatting data. It does not have to be with javascript specifically. JSON interacts with the front end and back end by being part of the HTTP request/response and transfers the data between the ends.

# Provide instances in the full stack process when you refactored code to improve functionality and efficiencies and name the benefits that come from reusable user interface (UI) components

The handlebars were a large part of refactoring code to be more efficient. Instead of specifying what we wanted to display on the page, using static images and code that would only bring one thing into view, we refactored the code to use handlebars so the content could be displayed more flexibly and change depending on what was requested. Resuable UI's also allow greater scalabilty in projects and are simpler to work with, meaning other project members can easily change or read code as well.

# Testing
# Explain your understanding of methods, endpoints, and security in a full stack application

HTTP methods are how clients interact with servers. This include GET, POST, PUT, and DELETE but there are more as well. Endpoints are URLs that allow clients to access websites and are often reached through the methods. Security for this would include creating a user/login for someone looking to interact with a website to keep anyone who shouldn't have access from doing anything with it.

# Reflection
# How has this course helped you in reaching your professional goals?

I am going into a job in January that will be full stack development and going through the process has certainly helped me understand how it works better. I have used angular and API's before, but express was a new tool for me to use. Creating a project from the ground up, which I am unlikely to do in my new job, also was a good learning point as I'm unlikely to make something new while working based on my internship.

# What skills have you learned, developed, or mastered in this course to help you become a more marketable candidate in your career field?

Learning about handlebars and javascript was very helpful as those were two things that I had heard of but hadn't yet been able to experience personally, at least not in as deep a manner as in this class. I knew what they were but had never programmed them myself. It was good to get that experience to put it on my resume.
